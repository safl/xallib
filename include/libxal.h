/**
 * Public API for the XAL library
 *
 * On-disk Storage Format
 * ======================
 *
 * The on-disk storage format is not exposed in these headers since the intent is that the user
 * should not need to rely on them. Rather, they are handled by the library-implementation and
 * values communicated via pretty-printers and transformed into "simplified" representations.
 *
 * Endianness
 * ----------
 *
 * The XFS on-disk format make use of integer values in big-endian format, thus value convertion
 * to little-endian is needed on e.g. x86 systems. Such helpers are not exposed here, rather the
 * conversions are performed by the library and the representations found here are in "native"
 * format.
 *
 * Files and Directories
 * ---------------------
 *
 * XFS has 4 or 5 ways of storing directory indexes (filename + inode number) optimized by
 * use-case. When XAL parses these from the on-disk-format, then they normalized into the
 * form represented by 'struct xal_inode'. All inodes are backed by a overcommitted memory-map
 * represented by 'struct xal_pool'.
 *
